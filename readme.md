Module 10 svg logomaker
The SVG Logo Maker is a Node.js command-line application designed to generate custom logos and save them as SVG files. This application utilizes several dependencies, including NPM packages SVG.JS, inquirer, Jest, and svg-to-png.

When running the application, users will be prompted to provide the following inputs:

The desired color for the logo.
The preferred shape for the logo.
The text to display on the logo.
Once the user has provided all the required information, the application will create a custom logo in SVG format and save it as an SVG file for easy use.
